То есть игра свершится только через 3 блока.</li>\n    <li>Так как это всеобщий смарт-контракт, у которого нет владельца и с которого никто не получает прибыли, то и выигрыши в нем самые большие.</li>\n    <li>Вдобавок, даже если банк dAPP получит какую-то прибыль - то она по сути &quot;сжигается&quot;, что на руку всем пользователям.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><b>Правила игры</b><br>\nВы можете сделать выбор и поставить свою ставку на <code>ЗЕРО</code>, нечетное или четное число. Выигрышное число берется из подписи блока, который будет создан позже блока, в котором вы сделали ставку. В его подписи ищутся 3 цифры начиная справа и складываются.\n    Если все три цифры были равны 0 - то выпало <code>ЗЕРО</code>.\n    Если все равны 7 - то <code>БИНГО</code>, если все цифры равны между собой - <code>МАЖОР</code>. Иначе они складываются отбрасывая старшие разряды, так что получаем одну цифру от 0 до 9.\n    Выигрыш зависит от вашей ставки:\n\n<ol>\n    <li>вы поставили на <code>ЗЕРО</code>. Если выпало <code>ЗЕРО</code> - выигрыш <code>х777</code> от вашей ставки. Иначе проигрыш</li>\n    <li>вы поставили на <code>чёт</code> или <code>нечёт</code> и если выпало <code>БИНГО</code>, то выигрыш <code>х77</code>, а если <code>МАЖОР</code> - то <code>х12</code></li>\n    <li>иначе выигрыш умножает ставку на 2 - если вы угадали, и выпала цифра от 1 до 8 включительно.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Таким образом мы получаем 4-ре цифры чётных и 4-ре цифры нечётных, которые дают выигрыш если угадать <code>чёт</code> или <code>нечёт</code>. Цифры 0 и 9 не дают выигрыша.</p>\n<p><b>Как играть</b><br>\nСтавка делается путем перевода протокольных активов <code>ERA</code> или <code>COMPU</code> на счет смарт-контракта <code>APPC5iANrt6tdDfGHCLV5zmCnjvViC5Bgj</code>. Размер ставки равен сумме перевода. Размер ставки должен быть не меньше - <strong>0.05</strong> для <code>COMPU</code>  и не менее <strong>1</strong> для <code>ERA</code>. Ваш выбор указывается в заголовке транзакции как одна цифра от 0 до 2, где:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>0 - вы поставили на <code>ЗЕРО</code></li>\n    <li>1 - вы поставили на <code>нечёт</code></li>\n    <li>2 - вы поставили на <code>чёт</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Если правила транзакции не соблюдены, то смарт-контракт не активируется и платеж будет утрачен.\n    Посмотреть результаты игры можно в сканере блоков - в приписке к вашей транзакции будет результат. А так же можно посмотреть список вычисленных транзакций по вашему счёту.\n    Найти все выигрыши можно если в сканере (блокэксплорере) в разделе Транзакции сделать поиск по размеру выигрыша, например: <code>x77</code>\n</p>",

И еще часть дохода идет по реферальной структуре на 4-ре уровня вверх. Начисление процентов производит и при приходе на ваш счет, то есть тратить средства не обязательно чтобы получить доход от стейкинга. Годовой доход зависит от числа приглашенных тобой игроков (первый уровень) и от суммы актива хранящегося на всех их счетах. Чем больше то и то тем коэффициент выше. Проверить работу можно в тестовой сети - отослав на счет dApp транзакцию с командой init - вы получите актив контракта. Дальше можете его погонять между счетами и посмотреть начисления процентов.
