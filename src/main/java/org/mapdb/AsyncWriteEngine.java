/**
 * {@link Engine} wrapper which provides asynchronous serialization and asynchronous write.
 * This class takes an object instance, passes it to background writer thread (using Write Queue)
 * where it is serialized and written to disk. Async write does not affect commit durability,
 * Write Queue is flushed into disk on each commit. Modified records are held in small instance cache,
 * until they are written into disk.
 *
 * This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by calling {@link DBMaker#asyncWriteEnable()}.
 * Write Cache is flushed in regular intervals or when it becomes full. Flush interval is 100 ms by default and
 * can be controlled by {@link DBMaker#asyncWriteFlushDelay(int)}. Increasing this interval may improve performance
 * in scenarios where frequently modified items should be cached, typically {@link BTreeMap} import where keys
 * are presorted.
 *
 * Asynchronous write does not affect commit durability. Write Queue is flushed during each commit, rollback and close call.
 * Those method also block until all records are written.
 * You may flush Write Queue manually by using {@link org.mapdb.AsyncWriteEngine#clearCache()}  method.
 * There is global lock which prevents record being updated while commit is in progress.
 *
 * This wrapper starts one threads named `MapDB writer #N` (where N is static counter).
 * Async Writer takes modified records from Write Queue and writes them into store.
 * It also preallocates new recids, as finding empty `recids` takes time so small stash is pre-allocated.
 * It runs as `daemon`, so it does not prevent JVM to exit.
 *
 * Asynchronous Writes have several advantages (especially for single threaded user). But there are two things
 * user should be aware of:
 *
 *  * Because data are serialized on back-ground thread, they need to be thread safe or better immutable.
 *    When you insert record into MapDB and modify it latter, this modification may happen before item
 *    was serialized and you may not be sure what version was persisted
 *
 *  * Inter-thread communication has some overhead.
 *    There is also only single Writer Thread, which may create  single bottle-neck.
 *    This usually not issue for
 *    single or two threads, but in multi-threaded environment it may decrease performance.
 *    So in truly concurrent environments with many updates (network servers, parallel computing )
 *    you should keep Asynchronous Writes disabled.
