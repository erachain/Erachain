/**
 * Compiler Configuration. There are some static final boolean fields, which describe features MapDB was compiled with.
 * <p/>
 * MapDB can be compiled with/without some features. For example fine logging is useful for debuging,
 * but should not be present in production version. Java does not have preprocessor so
 * we use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_code_elimination">Dead code elimination</a> to achieve it.
 * <p/>
 * Typical usage:
 * <pre>
 *     if(CC.PARANOID && arg.calculateSize()!=33){  //calculateSize may take long time
 *         throw new IllegalArgumentException("wrong size");
 *     }
 * </pre>
